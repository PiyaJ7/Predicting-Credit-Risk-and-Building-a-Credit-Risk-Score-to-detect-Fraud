# Predicting Credit Risk and Building a Credit Risk Score to detect Fraud

## INTRODUCTION
Fraudulent activities significantly challenge financial institutions, causing substantial losses and eroding trust. Traditional methods often struggle to keep up with evolving fraud patterns. This project aims to develop a robust fraud detection and risk scoring system leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to predict fraudulent behaviors and accurately assign risk scores, ensuring proactive and effective mitigation.

## METHODS

### DATASET
Sourced a dataset containing user account activities, transactions, and risk-related attributes. Key features include:
- Account open date
- Age
- Location
- Occupation
- Income level
- Fico score
- Delinquency status and more

### PREPROCESSING
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation using mean, median, or mode.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Removed outliers after identifying data based on variable constraints.
- **Feature Encoding**: Converted Boolean variables to binary and normalized date formats.

### MODEL SELECTION
- Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models for subsets of the dataset.
- Selected the Gradient Boosting model, offering high predictive accuracy, effectively handling imbalanced datasets, and capturing complex, non-linear relationships between features.

### RISK SCORING ALGORITHM
A risk score is generated by transforming the log-odds output from the Gradient Boosting model, providing a quantitative measure of the likelihood of the target outcome.

### EVALUATION METRICS
Metrics used include:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC for classification

## RESULTS
- The Gradient Boosting model achieved an **AUC-ROC score of 0.82**, demonstrating strong predictive performance.
- Overall accuracy of **87%**, with a precision of **90%** for non-fraudulent cases and **79%** for fraudulent cases, ensuring high reliability in predictions.
- **SHAP analysis** was utilized to interpret the model, identifying the most influential features affecting risk scores.
- Risk scores were generated, ranging from **94.07 to 856.78**, showcasing the model's ability to assign precise risk scores for individual cases.
